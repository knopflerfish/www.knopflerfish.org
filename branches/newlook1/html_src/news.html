	  Corrected issues regarding signed bundles being incorrectly marked as not 
	  completely signed. Thera also seems to be a problem in the JarInputStream class
	  implementation in Oracle JRE (Java 6 & 7). If there are user/non standard 
	  jar related files in the META-INF directory in the bundle's JAR, 
	  and they directly follow the standard META-INF signature related files,
	  the Oracle JRE fails to find the certificates for the addtional files,
	  and KF will mark the bundle as not completely signed. Setting the property 
	  <tt>org.knopflerfish.framework.bundlestorage.file.jar_verifier_bug</tt> to true will
	  instruct KF to assume they are properly signed. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  The versions 5.3.8 and 5.3.9 of the framework shall be regarded as 
	  intermediate releases and can be ignored as they didn't address all problems.

    Build system fix. API versions of several bundles updated.<br>
    A fix has been made in the KF build system for issue 
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3402741&group_id=82798&atid=567241">
      3402741 </a> 
    by adding implicit imports to the API version of the bundle of all
    packages exported  by the same bundle. The implicit import
    will get a version range starting with the exported version up to
    the next major version (excluded). This default setting is per
    recommendation of the OSGi Specification. 
    <p>
      This fix affects primarily the API version of certain bundles which exports multiple
      packages, and previously did not explicitly import their own exported packages. 
      The bundles listed below are all such API bundles. They have been
      updated to a new bug fix version (x.x.N) and are now corrected to
      have an implicit import of their respective exported
      packages. 
      <ul class="kf">
	<li>Blueprint (API) 1.0.1</li>
	<li>Deployment Admin (API) 1.0.2</li>
	<li>DMTree 1.0.2 </li>
	<li>HTTP-Server 3.0.6  </li>
	<li>IO (API) 3.0.1 </li>
	<li>Log Service 3.0.6 </li>
	<li>User Admin 3.0.2</li>
	<li>Desktop 3.1.7</li>
	<li>JSDK 2.5.0.kf3-2</li>
	<li>Serial Port Device 2.0.1</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      API bundles with a single exported package are also affected and
      will get the same  implicit import. However the bundle version of these bundles
      have not been updated since this change has no real impact on
      such bundles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "_all" bundles are also affected such that they get the same
      version range on implicit imports. Previously they would get an
      implicit import with exactly the same version as the export. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The implementation versions of the bundles are not affected by
      this change.
