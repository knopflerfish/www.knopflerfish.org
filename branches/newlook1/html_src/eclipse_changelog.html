    <dt> Launch Configuration </dt>
    <dd>
      Added support for version ranges in package imports and exports. This fixes the strange errors 
      shown in the missing packages column in the bundles tab when package version was specified.
    </dd>
    <dd>
      Added support for optional imports. If a manifest specifies an import as optional and the 
      package is missing, it will say so in the Missing Packages column, but the row will not turn red.
    </dd>
    <dd>
      The bundle info box, located between the Available bundles tree and Selected bundles list, has
      been removed in order to give more space to the Selected bundles list.
    </dd>
    <dd>
      There was a problem when debugging bundles from the framework repository or external
      locations. The source code shown when stepping was attached as external and could not be 
      modified. Now the source path computer will check if the source exists in the workspace, and if 
      so attach it as a workspace folder which allows it to be edited.
