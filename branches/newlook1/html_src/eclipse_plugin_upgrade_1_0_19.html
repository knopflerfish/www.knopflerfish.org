<h2>Upgrading to Eclipse plug-in 1.0.19</h2>

  <p>If you have an earlier version of the plugin and try to update 10
  1.0.19 you will probably get an error saying there is a conflict
  with the earlier version. In this case you will need to uninstall
  the earlier version, but BEFORE you do this make sure you save the
  KF plugin settings. The KF plugin stores data in two places, as
  preferences and as launch configurations. Preferences holds
  information about which frameworks, environments and repositories
  that have been configured. Launch configurations is all your
  debug/run configurations.</p>

  <p>To save the preferences select File/Export..., in the dialog
  shown select General-Preferences and select next. Check the
  knopflerfish preferences, specify where to save it and finish. This
  file can later be imported to restore these preferences. This is
  also described here <a href="/eclipse_preferences.html">
  http://www.knopflerfish.org/eclipse_preferences.html</a></p>

  <p>To save launch configurations select File/Export..., in the
  dialog shown select Run/Debug-Launch Configurations and select
  next. Check the knopflerfish launch configurations, specify
  directory to save to and finish. These launch configurations can
  later be imported.</p>
