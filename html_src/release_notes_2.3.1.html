<h2>Release Notes 2.3.1</h2>

Minor release of Knopflerfish. Released 2009-05-08


<h3> Framework (Core), updated to version 4.1.3</h3>

<div class="release_notes">
  <dl>
    <dt>Framework 4.1.3</dt>
    <dd>
      Fixed parsing exception of saved ConditionalPermissionInfo data
      during restart of framework. Fixed persistent saving of
      initialBundleStartLevel in start level service.
    </dd>
    <dd>
      Fixed ClassCastException in getHeaders() for extension
      bundles. Rectified PackageAdmin.getExportedPackages() so that
      doesn't include packages from extension bundles and unresolved
      bundles.
    </dd>

<h3> Knopflerfish Services</h3>

<div class="release_notes">
  <dl>
    <dt>Crimson 2.0.1</dt>
    <dd>
      Fixed a class-loader issue that made it impossible to directly use
      the DocumentBuilderFactory to create new instances. Note that this
      bundle is not needed on new Java releases (the recommendation is to
      use the XML-parsing that is provided by the JRE, or the
      Xerces-bundle).
    </dd>

    <dt>Xalan 2.7.1.1</dt>
    <dd>
      This bundle now exports the javax.xml.transform.* packages. This makes
      it possible to use the method TranformerFactory.newInstance() to get
      a transformer-factory instance when the javax.xml.transform package
      have been imported from the Xalan-bundle.
      <P>
	Note that these packages are exported with a version with the
	qualifier set to ".1" (1.3.0.1 to be precise) this makes them
	"better" than the version exported by the Xerces-bundle even though
	that they actually are identical. This trick makes the Xalan
	provided version of the packages the preferred one when bundles are
	resolved, thus hiding the version exported by the Xerces-bundle.
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Desktop 2.3.2</dt>
    <dd>
      Fixed a potential NullPointerException and removed a debug print.
    </dd>
    <dd>
      UI initialization is now done on the AWT Event Thread to avoid
      potential deadlocks inside Swing AWT.
