      Knopflerfish 5.1 released, new minor release of KF5

    <p>
      <a href="download.html">Knopflerfish 5.1</a> is released and includes several minor 
      enhancements as well as all bug fixes made since KF 5.0 was released. The 5.1 release also 
      includes fixed related to Java 8 and Knopflerfish 5.1 passes all tests on Java 7 and 8 as well
      as older Java versions, and embedded Java profiles.
    </p>
    The new key features in Knopflerfish 5.1 are:
    <ul>
      <li>Support for starting from a single jar that includes all jars, xargs and 
	property files needed to start the entire system</li>
      <li>Knopflerfish framework can now be executed in read only mode, i.e. no files are 
	written by the framework. This assumes bundles are installed as reference file URLs.</li>
      <li>UserAdmin is completely self-contained, i.e. no dependencies on KF specific bundles</li>
      <li>CM's persistent storage has been made more robust and fault resilient</li>
      <li>HTTP Server now handles chunked transfer encoding correctly</li>
      <li>Minor fixes in SCR</li>
      <li>Repository Commands supports -r flag which recursively finds and installs dependencies.</li>
          </ul>
