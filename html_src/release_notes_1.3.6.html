Release Notes Knopflerfish 1.3.6
--------------------------------

  Maintenance release of Knopflerfish 1.3 (OSGi R3)

  Here follows a breakdown of the most important changes since the 
  last release.

=== Framework (Core) ===

  A number of changes to enable bundles with few permissions to work
  correctly when security is enabled.

  All permission checks are now performed via the active Security
  Manager to enable interception of such checks by a custom Security
  Manager implementation.

  The security policy implementation used by the framework now

  implementation, thus allowing specification of permissions for
  non-bundle packages via the default policy file.


=== Services (Compendium) ===
      
  No changes.


=== Misc (KF specific, start scripts, build system etc ===

  Some build system changes have been back-ported from the
  Knopflerfish 2.0 series. E.g., usage of a local bcel.jar in ant/lib,
  new release note page and a change log based on svn comments, ...
