Welcome to the Knopflerfish website. 
The goal with the Knopflerfish project is to develop and distribute
easy to use open source code, build tools and applications, related to
the OSGi framework. See <a href="charter_se.html">charter</a> for details.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.gatespacetelematics.com">Gatespace Telematics</a>
is the maintainer and sponsor of the 
<a href="http://www.knopflerfish.org">Knopflerfish project</a> and has
several developers assigned to develop and maintain the Knopflerfish
OSGi distribution.  
</p>
<p>
OSGi, Open Service Gateway Initiative,
specifies an industry standard Java application platform,
allowing multiple applications, to securely run in a
single JVM. These programs can share resources as data, functionality
and threads.
</p>
<p>
Applications areas for OSGi ranges from use as a service platform on
embedded devices, to plug-in mechanisms for larger programs.
The initial goal of OSGi was the embedded market, but other uses
are certainly possible.
</p>
<p>
