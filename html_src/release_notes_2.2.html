    <dt>OS name alias handling</dt>

    <dt>BundleClassPath</dt>
    <dd>
      Fix an issue with paths in the BundleClassPath manifest attribute
      that starts with a '/' when using memory storage. Reported in<br>
      https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=567241&aid=2198098&group_id=82798
    </dd>
    <dt>Fragment handling during uninstall</dt>
    <dd>
      Fixed a problem with fragment handling when uninstalling a bundle
      with attached fragments. Using package admin refresh on a fragment
      host bundle after update or uninstall of one of its attached
      fragments now results in a re-resolve operation of the host bundle.
    </dd>
    <dt>Misc</dt>
    <dd>
      Rearranged synchronized code to avoid dead lock between registerService and
      refreshPackages.

      instance shows the actual port obtained from the OS and not 0.
    </dd>
    <dt>  Event Admin 2.0.3 </dt>
    <dd>
